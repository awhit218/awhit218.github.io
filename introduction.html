            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>I was born and raised here in Charlotte and I live with my beautiful family. I am the oldest of two and I am currently raising a cat, her name is Lunar.</li>
            
              <li><strong> Academic Background:</strong>I am currently a sophomore here at UNCC majoring in health systems management, I did my freshman year back at CPCC, making this my first year here at UNCC.</li>  
               <li><strong> Background in this Subject:</strong>I don't have much background in this subject besides making a few websites on my own in a few computer classes which were back in middle school.</li>  
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Program:</strong> Mac OS</li> 
                
                <li><strong>Courses Im Taking:</strong><ol>
                <li><strong>HSMT 2101:</strong> Introduction to Health Systems Management- I'm taking this class because it is a part of my major to make sure I understand the fundamentals and basics of the overall major.</li>
                <li><strong>HSMT 2103:</strong> Introduction to Human Resources Management- I'm taking this class because it is also a part of my major, but I decided to take this particular class early because it looked interesting and I wanted to learn more about it.</li>
                <li><strong>HSMT 2104:</strong> Introduction to the US HealthCare System- This is another class that is required for my major and it's just introducing me to the healthcare system and breaking down how everything works.</li>
                <li><strong>ITSC 1110:</strong> Computer Science Principles- Im taking this class because I wanted to expand and get out of my comfort zone. I’ve always been intrigued by how certain things work when it comes to things online, so I thought this would be a perfect class for me to take.</li>
                <li><strong>SOCY 2115-001:</strong> Introduction to Organizations- Sociology has always been interesting to me, so interesting that I made it my minor, so I wanted to take this class to continue my journey in learning about certain things.
                </li></ol></li>
               
                
                
               <li><strong> Funny/interesting thing about myself:</strong>I recently came down with a condition where if you apply enough pressure to my skin or scratch me, I will puff up.</li>
               <li><strong>I’d also like to share:</strong> If I wasn’t going into healthcare, I would be a writer.
